This is a board specially made for DiyHue and WS2812/WS2815 strips based on the new ESP32-C3 controller (RISC-V CPU). 
## Features
 - P-Channel mosfet that cut the power to the strip when all leds are soft off in order to save the energy (WS2812 leds draw ~1mA / led while off).
 - Two buttons that allow to control the power (short press) , brightness (long press) and factory reset (both buttons pressed)
 - Led indicator for WiFi connectivity (the led turn off once wifi connection is established and will blink when connection is lost).
 - 2.4GHz Chip Antenna.
