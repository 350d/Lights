# 433Mhz Power Socket - Control (Hue Bulb Emulation)
This ESP-8266 Firmware controls generic 433Mhz Power Sockets. 
Showing up as regular Hue Bulbs with ON/OFF feature.

* I used one of those cheap Transmitters. 
* Directly connected to VCC(+3,3V) GPIO4 (Data) and GND.
* You need to Edit your **"House Code"** in order to control the correct Sockets!
